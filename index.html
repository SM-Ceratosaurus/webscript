		   <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name's S.M. Cerato, and I strive to know more. About plants, insects, industries, and you. I love learning the in's and out's of the world, and this is a small fraction of my path to explore. You will find my projects, passions, and notes out here in the wilderness.
				
				My content follows a variety of mediums, from the arts, to photography, to coding, to data collection and coalescence. I tidy up existing data and I make extremely niche contraptions that, if you ever needed them, you'd be using them daily like me. I hope they serve you well as they did me to discover them.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
		<p> I have a penchant for picking up new skills to add to my toolbox. Here's a brief look at my capabilities: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Creativity</b> - Sometimes, all you need is another pair of eyes and a different point of view of a problem to leap towards a solution plan. My knack for creativity in both the arts and the practical has helped me and the teams I've been apart of find cost-effective sollutions to road blocks.</li>
			
            <li><b>Interpersonal Knowledge</b> - I'm great at listening to the concerns of others, and coming up with solutions for both themselves and their jobs at work. I've mediated between multiple coworkers when misunderstandings and friction arose. I can keep the team working together so they can finish the job.</li>
			
            <li><b>Attention To Details</b> - Did you notice that the doorknobs on the factory floor have jiggled loose from their screw installations? I did when I visited last week. I have a keen eye to details, and I often find the smaller signs of disruption and inconsistencies that get looked over.</li>
			
			<li><b>Organized</b> - You'll never lose track of the warehouse keys when I'm on board. I can keep track of important items and keep my work space tidy. I've always followed the saying, <i>"Don't put it down, Put it away"</i> in my life, and it shows in my clean work enviroments.</li>
			
			<li><b>Dedicated</b> - Give me a task and I'll see to that it's finished to completion. I pride myself to the values of my employer, and the standards of work will always be followed.</li>
        </ul>
